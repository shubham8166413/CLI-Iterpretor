Create src/demo-retry.ts - a demonstration script showing retry logic:

- Import lookup, create from apiClient
- Import logger, Lead type
- Create async function demonstrateRetryBehavior()

Tests to run:
1. Lookup existing lead (alice@example.com)
2. Lookup non-existing lead 
3. Create new lead with unique email (use Date.now())
4. Fire 5 parallel create requests to trigger rate limits

Output format:
- Header banner explaining what server simulates (429, 500, delays)
- Section headers for each test
- ✅/❌ emojis for success/failure
- Summary at end explaining:
  - Yellow warn logs = retry attempts
  - Exponential backoff timing
  - Which errors retry (429, 500) vs don't (400)
  - Max 3 retries
